# UnityTilemapMask
The mask component. Works the same as SpriteMask, but used for tilemaps. Very easy to use!

### How to use

1. Download the TilemapMask folder
2. Add the `TilemapMask.cs` script to an object that the Tilemap is on and set the `Mask Cell` field to the `FloorMask.prefab`.
3. Click `Generate Mask` to generate mask for your tilemap.
4. Set `Mask Interaction` to `Visible Inside Mask` inside all `SpriteRenderers` of your `Sprites`, which should only appear inside the mask.
5. See the result! :)
